# MixTape
A C# console application containing three games:
1. MadLibs! - a choice of three MadLib stories
2. Escape the Maze - a 10x10 text based 'dungeon crawler' 
3. Wheel of Misfortune - a Wheel of Fortune/Hangman style 'guess the phrase' game

This is my first C# 'from scratch' development attempt.
